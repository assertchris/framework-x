# Fibers

Fibers allow consuming async APIs using a synchronous code flow. The `await()`
function can be used to "await" a promise or to "unwrap" its resolution value.
Fibers are a core ingredient of PHP 8.1+, but the same syntax also works on
older PHP versions to some degree if you only have limited concurrency.

## Quickstart

Let's take a look at the most basic fiber usage by using an
[async database](../integrations/database.md) integration with X:

```php title="public/index.php"
<?php

use function React\Async\await;

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$credentials = 'alice:secret@localhost/bookstore?idle=0.001';
$db = (new React\MySQL\Factory(React\EventLoop\Loop::get()))->createLazyConnection($credentials);

$app = new FrameworkX\App();

$app->get('/book', function () use ($db) {
    $result = await($db->query(
        'SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM book'
    ));

    $data = "Found " . $result->resultRows[0]['count'] . " books\n";
    return new React\Http\Message\Response(
        200,
        [],
        $data
    );
});

$app->run();
```

As you can see, using an async database adapter in X is very similar to using
a normal, synchronous database adapter such as PDO. The only difference is how
the `$db->query()` call returns a promise that we call `await()` on to get the
return value.

At the moment, fibers are available as a development version by installing
[react/async](https://github.com/reactphp/async) from a development branch
like this:

```bash
$ composer require react/async:dev-main
```

Installing this package version requires PHP 8.1+ (2021-11-25) as fibers are a
core ingredient of PHP 8.1+. We understand that adoption of this very new PHP
version is going to take some time, so we acknowledge that this is probably one
of the largest limitations of using fibers at the moment.

But don't worry, we're committed to providing long-term support (LTS) options
and providing a smooth upgrade path. As such, we also provide limited support
for older PHP versions using a compatible API without taking advantage of newer
language features. By installing the v3 development version of this package, the
same `await()` syntax also works on PHP 7.1+ to some degree if you only have
limited concurrency. You can install either supported development version like
this:

```bash
$ composer require react/async:"dev-main || 3.x-dev"
```

This way, you have a much smoother upgrade path, as you can already start using
the future API for testing and development purposes and upgrade your PHP version
for production use at a later time.

## Usage

Once installed (see requirements above), fibers are very easy to use – because
you simply can't see them – which in turn makes them quite hard to explain.

The gist is that whenever you're working with an async API that returns a
promise, you simply call the `await()` function on it in order to "await" its
value or to "unwrap" its resolution value. Fibers are an internal implementation
detail provided by [react/async](https://github.com/reactphp/async), so you
can simply rely on the `await()` function:

```php
<?php

use function React\Async\await;

// ...

$browser = new React\Http\Browser();
$promise = $browser->get('https://example.com/');

try {
    $response = await($promise);
    assert($response instanceof Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface);
    echo $response->getBody();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}
```

See [`await()` documentation](https://github.com/reactphp/async#await) for more
details.

## FAQ

### When to use fibers?

As a rule of thumb, you'll likely want to use fibers when you have PHP 8.1+
available and want to use async APIs that look just like their synchronous
counterparts. This makes them much easier to integrate and there's hope this
will foster a larger ecosystem in the future.

We also provide support for [coroutines](coroutines.md) and
[promises](promises.md) on all supported PHP versions as an alternative.
Coroutines allow consuming async APIs in a way that resembles a synchronous
code flow using the `yield` keyword. You can also directly use promises as a
core building block used in all our async APIs for maximum performance.

### How do fibers work?

Fibers are a means of creating code blocks that can be paused and resumed, but
the details are a bit more involved. For more details, see our
[blog post](https://clue.engineering/2021/fibers-in-php).
